 * Provides restored DeltaSpike 2.0 classes, such as {@code AnnotatedTypeBuilder}, to enable advanced CDI type and
 * annotation manipulation.
 * <p>
 * These classes were removed from DeltaSpike 2.0 and are maintained here for backward compatibility and to support
 * advanced use cases not covered by the standard CDI API.
 * <p>
 * <b>Note:</b> This code is not part of the official DeltaSpike distribution and should be maintained as needed for
 * compatibility with future CDI versions.
